# Machine_Learning_tutorial_2
The tutorial will help budding data scientists get familiar with machine learning concepts

Anomaly Detection

we will implement an anomaly detection algorithm using the Gaussian model to detect anomalous behavior in a 2D dataset first and then a high-dimensional dataset.
